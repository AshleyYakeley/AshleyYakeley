Hi, I'm Ashley, a software developer living in Seattle.

I want to improve the way people think, through software and mathematics, and especially the programming language concept of type.
Pinafore is my main effort in this area.

## Interests

* Information representation and user interface, with an eye towards composability
* Programming languages: Haskell, functional programming, type systems, Algebraic Subtyping, declarative languages, theorem-proving languages
* Decentralization and permissionlessness: identity, interaction, transaction

## Projects

* [**Pinafore**](https://github.com/AshleyYakeley/Truth), a language for structuring and storing information, and creating GTK user interfaces for it. It's currently the most sophisticated implementation of the type system Algebraic Subtyping.

* [**NixVirt**](https://github.com/AshleyYakeley/NixVirt), a Nix flake that lets you declare virtual machines and associated objects via libvirt.
